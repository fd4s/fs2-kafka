    * the particular `TopicPartition`. These streams will be closed only when
    * a partition is revoked.<br>
    * <br>
    * With the default assignor, all previous partitions are revoked at
    * once, and a new set of partitions is assigned to a consumer on each
    * rebalance. In this case, each returned `Map` contains the full partition
    * assignment for the consumer. And all streams from the previous assignment are closed.
    * It means, that `partitionsMapStream` reflects
    * the default assignment process in a streaming manner.<br>
    * <br>
    * This may not be the case when a custom assignor is configured in the
    * consumer. When using the `CooperativeStickyAssignor`, for instance,
    * partitions may be revoked individually. In this case, each
    * element in the stream (each`Map`) will contain only streams for newly assigned
    * partitions. Previously returned streams for partitions that are retained
    * will remain active. Only streams for revoked partitions will be closed.<br>
    * <br>
    * This is the most generic `Stream` method. If you don't need such control,
    * consider using `partitionedStream` or `stream` methods. They are both
    * based on a `partitionsMapStream`.
