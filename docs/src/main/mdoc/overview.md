Functional backpressured streams for consuming and producing Kafka records. Exposes a small interface, while taking care of common functionality: batch consuming and producing records, batched offset commits, offset commit recovery, and topic administration, while also simplifying client configuration.

Documentation is kept up-to-date, currently documenting v@LATEST_VERSION@ on Scala @DOCS_SCALA_MINOR_VERSION@.

## Getting Started

To get started with [sbt](https://scala-sbt.org), simply add the following line to your `build.sbt` file.

```scala
libraryDependencies += "@ORGANIZATION@" %% "@CORE_MODULE_NAME@" % "@LATEST_VERSION@"
```

Published for Scala @SCALA_PUBLISH_VERSIONS@. For changes, refer to the [release notes](https://github.com/fd4s/fs2-kafka/releases).

For Scala 2.12, enable partial unification by adding the following line to `build.sbt`.

```scala
scalacOptions += "-Ypartial-unification"
```

### Modules

For [Avro](https://avro.apache.org) support using [Vulcan](modules.md#vulcan), add the following lines to your `build.sbt` file.

```scala
resolvers += "confluent" at "https://packages.confluent.io/maven/"

libraryDependencies += "@ORGANIZATION@" %% "@VULCAN_MODULE_NAME@" % "@LATEST_VERSION@"
```

### Signatures

Stable release artifacts are signed with the [`E97C 64AB 4987 7F74`](https://keys.openpgp.org/search?q=D9A5006CBC771CEAEB0CA118E97C64AB49877F74) key.

### Compatibility

Backwards binary-compatibility for the library is guaranteed between minor and patch versions.<br>
Version `@LATEST_MAJOR_VERSION@.a.b` is backwards binary-compatible with `@LATEST_MAJOR_VERSION@.c.d` for any `a > c` or `a = c` and `b > d`.

Please note binary-compatibility is not guaranteed between milestone releases.

### Snapshot Releases

To use the latest snapshot release, add the following lines to your `build.sbt` file.

```scala
resolvers += Resolver.sonatypeRepo("snapshots")

libraryDependencies += "@ORGANIZATION@" %% "@CORE_MODULE_NAME@" % "@LATEST_SNAPSHOT_VERSION@"
```

## Dependencies

Refer to the table below for dependencies and version support across modules.
